PREREQUISITES

You won't get far without these Perl modules and command-line
applications installed and available in your default PATH:

	Date::Parse	Required.  See CPAN http://cpan.org/ if you need it.
			(You can run "perl -MDate::Parse -e1" to check.
			If you get any errors, you need a copy)

	Audio::Wav	Optional, but recommended.  Available from CPAN.

	HTML::Parser	Required for the makehbx script.  See
			http://catchen.org/hillsboro/ for more info on
			HBX.

	shorten		If you deal with Shorten files, you need this.
			http://etree.org/shnutils/shorten/

	flac		If you deal with FLAC files, you need this
			http://flac.sourceforge.net/ .  Make sure
			metaflac is available as well to do tagging.

	shntool		Highly recommended.  Available from
			http://etree.org/shnutils/shntool/

	cdrecord        If you plan to burn one (or 1000...) down,

	lame		If you intend on making any MP3s, you need this.
			http://lame.sourceforge.net/

	oggenc		Similarly, if you plan on making any Ogg Vorbis
			files using shn2ogg you will need this.

Should be as simple as:

	make
	make install

You can specify options to your hearts content if you know your way
around the Perl MakeMaker toolset.
