INSTALLATION

Installing etree-scripts should be as simple as:

	# Create the Build script
	% perl Build.PL	 

	# Install any missing prerequisites (Date::Parse, Audio::Wav, etc.)

	% ./Build installdeps

	# Install etree-scripts
	% ./Build install

You can specify options to your hearts content if you know your way
around the Perl Module::Build toolset.  If you're installing on a UNIX
system you may need to run "sudo ./Build ..." to handle the
installation steps.

ADDITIONAL TOOLS

You'll also need the following command line tools:

	shorten		If you deal with Shorten files, you need this.
			http://etree.org/shnutils/shorten/

	flac		If you deal with FLAC files, you need this
			http://flac.sourceforge.net/ .  Make sure
			metaflac is available as well to do tagging.

	shntool		Highly recommended.  Available from
			http://etree.org/shnutils/shntool/

	cdrecord        If you plan to burn one (or 1000...) down

	lame		If you intend on making any MP3s, you need this.
			http://lame.sourceforge.net/

	oggenc		Similarly, if you plan on making any Ogg Vorbis
			files using shn2ogg you will need this.
			http://www.xiph.org/ogg/vorbis/

CYGWIN USERS

There is now (or was) a single, self-contained package file available
for Cygwin users.  All you need is a basic Cygwin installation with
Perl installed.  Once you have this, download the
etree-scripts-<version>.cygwin.tar.gz file from Sourceforge
(http://etree-scripts.sourceforge.net/), and type:

	% cd /
	% tar xfz ~-/etree-scripts-<version>.cygwin.tar.gz

And everything you need will be installed and ready to use.  You can
try getting started by typing "perldoc flacify" or "perldoc shn2mp3".
