Announcing release 2.0 of etree-scripts, a set of (mostly) Perl
scripts that is of use to those lossless audio freaks (like myself)
who prefer to work from the command line.

Some important changes in this long overdue release:

* All new "flacify".  This program converts directories of WAV or SHN
  files to well-tagged, CD sector-aligned FLAC files.  Run on existing
  FLAC files, it adds/updates tags based on the show's info file.
  Seeders can use it to do their WAV > FLAC encoding and get tagging
  in the bargain.

* FLAC support is in all of the scripts now, even though their names
  might be "unshn" or "shn2mp3".

* Modularized the info parsing code that is the core of flacify,
  shn2mp3 and makehbx into a new Perl module called Etree::InfoFile.
  The parsing has been improved a great deal from the last offical
  release (1.4) and I hope others can make use of it.

* Added documentation to most of the scripts, resulting in
  man pages, and more detailed online help.

* Uses Perl's powerful Makefile.PL.  Simple installation (perl
  Makefile.PL; make; make install), better checking of dependencies,
  and numerous options for power users.  Debian packages also
  available.

* Portable.  Runs on Linux, Windows (Cygwin), MacOS X, *BSD, and
  anywhere else Perl and the lossless encoders (shorten, flac) have
  been ported.
