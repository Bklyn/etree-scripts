Announcing release 2.0 of etree-scripts.  etree-scripts is a set
of (mostly) Perl scripts of use to those lossless audio freaks like
myself who prefer to work from the command line.  I know there are
others out there :-)

Some important changes in this long overdue release:

* All new "flacify".  This program converts directories of WAV or SHN
  files to well-tagged, CD sector-aligned FLAC files.  Run on existing
  FLAC files, it adds/updates tags based on the show's info file.
  Seeders can use it to do their WAV > FLAC encoding and get tagging
  in the bargain.  FLAC support is in all of the scripts now.

* Modularized the info parsing code that is the core of flacify,
  shn2mp3 and makehbx into a new Perl module called Etree::InfoFile.
  The parsing has been improved a great deal from the last official
  release (1.4) and I hope others can make use of it.

* Added documentation to most of the scripts, resulting in
  new man pages and more detailed help messages.

* Now uses Perl's powerful Makefile.PL.  Simple installation (perl
  Makefile.PL; make; make install), better checking for dependencies,
  and numerous options for power users.  Debian packages also
  available.

* Portable.  Runs on Linux, Windows (Cygwin), MacOS X, *BSD, and
  anywhere else Perl and the lossless encoders (shorten, flac) have
  been ported.
